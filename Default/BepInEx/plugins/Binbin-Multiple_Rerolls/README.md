# Multiple Reroll mod

This is a simple mod that allows for multiple rerolls when in high madness or allows you to limit the number of rerolls when in low madness.

Made at the request of Stonewall 

Notes:
- To customize, press F5 in game and select the MultipleRerolls tab
- I'm not actually sure if this requires Obeliskial Essentials, it shouldn't but better safe than sorry
- It does not override the text you see in game when you hover over the reroll button, but it will set the number of rerolls regardless
- Should work for multiplayer. I believe technically only the host needs it installed, but that can lead to all sorts of other issues when the mods aren't identical across all players.

**Please let me know if you have any issues**
